# Problem
Let's assume that our stakeholder is a supermarket chain. 
The company operates in a very competitive and volatile environment, so this company has to
find new places to expand and leave unpromising locations.
This company wants to expand its network in Yekaterinburg city in Russia.
But the market in this city is very competitive 
and we need to do an analysis to find the best places to place supermarkets.
Ideally, we need to find crowded places in residential areas 
without supermarket competitors in the area.

# Data
We need to find places without supermarkets in the area, 
with public places nearby such as a shopping mall or business center.
Residential areas can be distinguished by the presence of schools, 
kindergartens, and hospitals in the district.
All the venues we need can be found using the Foursquare API. 
Districts can be distinguished by postal codes.
Postal codes can be obtained using the service https://geocode.xyz, 
also we can find the geospatial coordinates there.
